🎮 PlayOnchain

A gasless, smart contract-powered game arena where players compete in simple elimination-style games for stablecoin prizes. Powered by Flow, built for mass adoption.

⏱️ Concept Overview

The Arena is where it all happens. Gamemasters launch games into their Arena by deploying Game Smart Contracts, choosing rules, game types, and reward mechanics. Players gather in the Waitroom, enter using stablecoins, and once the game begins, compete trustlessly for prizes and bragging rights. Rewards like NFTs and POAPs are distributed automatically, and all transactions are gasless for players.

This setup empowers brands, artists, and teams to grow fan bases and run high-engagement events. Game creators earn fees via a marketplace of reusable game templates. Everyone wins: Gamemasters earn, players win, and fans return for more.

PlayOnchain is a protocol for hosting smart contract–driven games inside recurring, gasless, stablecoin-based arenas. A user becomes a Gamemaster by deploying a custom Game Smart Contract, selecting rules, prizes, and game timing. Players join Waitrooms with their wallet and stablecoins, and when the game begins, compete in interactive, rule-based games coded directly into the chain. Prizes are instantly paid out to winners; POAPs and NFTs are issued automatically.

The system is modular: anyone can spin up their own Arena, integrate simple games or oracle-driven outcomes, and onboard users into trustless, onchain competition—no tokens, no gas.

🎯 Hackathon Goal

Demonstrate a fully functional MVP of the PlayOnchain platform featuring:

A complete working implementation of the "Guess the Dice Roll" game, including smart contract execution, gasless entry via orchestration contracts, and stablecoin-based prize payouts.

A mock UI demo for an advanced game concept: "NFL – Pick Outcome of Next Possession", showcasing how oracle-driven prediction games could function (e.g., outcomes like Touchdown, Field Goal, or Turnover).

This MVP highlights how rule-based, trustless games can be played inside recurring Arenas with configurable game logic and onchain interactions.

🧱 Application Goal

Build a scalable, modular, onchain game platform where anyone can:

Deploy and own an Arena, where games happen on a recurring schedule.

Act as a Gamemaster, deploying Game Smart Contracts with flexible logic and timing.

Let Players join via a Waitroom and play gasless games with only stablecoins.

Use a marketplace of plug-and-play game templates, enabling creators to monetize their contracts.

Empower brands, artists, or teams to grow fan engagement through repeatable, reward-based experiences.

Leverage Orchestration Smart Contracts to manage:

Player Deposit Vaults

Gas Vaults

Distribution Modules

Randomizers and oracle feeds

Whether used for corporate training, fan engagement, sports prediction, or social games, PlayOnchain is the framework for onchain competition at scale.

PlayOnchain is a platform where anyone can become a Gamemaster—a host of recurring, onchain multiplayer games. Players enter rooms by paying a small stablecoin fee, and compete in randomized elimination-style games like "Guess the Dice" or "Pick the Card." The last person standing wins the pot (minus a fee to the Gamemaster). A POAP is issued to all players, and a winner’s NFT + prize is distributed onchain.

Games are gasless to players—Gamemasters cover all execution costs.

Designed to run on Flow for wallet UX + throughput, but extensible to EVM.

Core contracts written in Cadence for player gating, random selection, and fair reward logic.

Think Survivor meets Jackbox, with POAPs and stablecoin stakes.

🧠 Key Concepts

Gamemaster: A user who owns an Arena, deploys Game Smart Contracts, and controls timing, rules, and prize settings.

Arena: A gamified environment owned by a Gamemaster where Players compete in recurring games. Think of it like your own onchain arcade.

Waitroom: The pre-game lobby where Players lock in their stablecoin entry before the game begins.

Game Smart Contract: The contract that defines and executes a specific game’s logic (e.g., dice roll, trivia, prediction).

Orchestration Smart Contracts: A suite of shared modules that handle stablecoin deposits, gas sponsorship, winner payout distribution, and randomness.

Player: An onchain wallet that enters Arenas, competes in games, and receives rewards like NFTs or stablecoin payouts.
